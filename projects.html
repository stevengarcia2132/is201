    <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <div class="paragraph1">
    <p>
      I read my first self-improvement book in the summer of 2022. The book is
      called Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey and since then, I’ve been hooked
      on learning the little tricks that helped people be successful in their
      life. If you’re feeling stuck, lost, or unsure of how to improve your
      life, reading a self-help book can be a game-changer. I know firsthand how
      valuable the insights and guidance in these books can be. They offer
      practical tools, actionable steps, and uplifting messages to help you
      shift your mindset, overcome obstacles, and create the life you want.
      Whether you’re looking to improve your relationships, boost your
      confidence, or find more purpose and fulfillment, there’s a self-help book
      out there that can help you on your journey. So don’t hesitate to pick one
      up and give it a chance - it could be just the inspiration you need to
      take your life to the next level!

    <h1>Part 2: Getting the Data</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="paragraph2">
      <p>
        The first thing I did was navigate to the where all the products are
        listed on a page. Each page displays around 15 products so the important
        thing is to find the page that lets you navigate to all the available
        pages. You’ll know you on the right page when it looks like the images
        below.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <img src="./assets/img/amazon.png" alt="amazon" />
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <img src="./assets/img/pages.jpg" alt="pages" />
    </div>
    <br>
      <div class="paragraph1">
        When you find the correct page you want to save all the html code into a
        file. This can easily be done by pressing Ctrl+ ‘+’ + s. With all the HTML
        code for that page saved it’s time to move on to the coding!
      </div>
    <div class="center">
      <h1>Part 3: Scraping the Page</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1">
      Below is all the code I used to scrape the title, number of reviews,
      rating,price and image link. Once you download and save the html code for
      the site make sure you save it as 'index.html'. In the code below the with
      open statement contains index.html so make sure its saved as that name.
      <br />
      <img src="./assets/img/code.png" alt="code" />
      <br />
      The first step was finding the class that contained the info for each
      product. Once i found what the name of the class was called, I searched
      for the variables I was interested within that class. I executed this code
      many times after I saved the next page of products as the index file.
      Every time I moved from product page one to product page two I edited one
      of the last lines of the work.py file and added ‘data2.json’. When i got
      to the 13 page of the product the bottom line read ‘data13.json’.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h1>Part 4: Reading and Cleaning the Data</h1>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div class="paragraph1">
    After running the code above many times, I ended up with 13 json files of
    data!
  </div>

      <br>
      <img src="./assets/img/jsons.png" alt="json" />
      <br>

      <div class="paragraph1">
        The next step was to get the data from each of these files and add them a
        dataframe. Luckily this part was much more straight forward! The hardest
        part was finding out how to read all the json files in one location. Check out the code below to see 
        how i did it
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <code class="mycode">
        CODE
        <br>
        import os import pandas as pd
        <br>
        # Set the directory containing the JSON
        <br>
        files directory = 'C:/Users/tinom/Downloads/' 
        <br>
         # Get a list of all JSON
         <br>
        files in the directory json_files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if
        f.endswith('.json')] 
        <br>
        # Read each JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame
        <br>
        dfs = [] for json_file in json_files: filepath = os.path.join(directory,
        json_file) df = pd.read_json(filepath) dfs.append(df) 
        <br>
        # Concatenate the DataFrames into a single DataFrame 
        <br>
        merged_df = pd.concat(dfs,
        ignore_index=True)
      </code>
      <br>
      <br>
  </div>
  
  <div class="center">
    <h1>Part 5: Final Touches</h1>

  </div>

  <div class="paragraph1">
      After I read them all into the merged_df it was time for the fun part!
      Cleaing and getting the data ready for analysis. This involved converting
      the numeric variables into numeric types instead of strings.
  </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <code class="mycode">
        CODE
        <br>
        # create a new column called "rating_value" 
        <br>
        merged_df['rating_value'] = merged_df['rating'].apply(lambda x: float(x.split()[0]))
        <br>
        merged_df.drop('rating', axis=1, inplace=True) 
        <br>
        merged_df['review'] = merged_df['review'].str.replace(r'[\(\)]', '') 
        <br>
        original_columns = merged_df.columns.tolist() 
        <br>
        new_col = ['title','review','price','rating_value','link']
        <br>
        new_df = merged_df.reindex(columns=new_col) 
        <br>
        new_df.to_csv("self-help books",index = False)
      </code>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="paragraph1">
        After finding, scraping and cleaning the data my table came out like this!

        Now that I have data that can be manipulated I’m ready to conduct
        exploratory data analysis and find correlations and trends in the data! If
